                <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
                <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story i've written as an adult (and certainly everyone that has been published), almost every email i've ever written , has been written on machines created by apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before i ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped me to realize the star Strek future i dreamed of as a kid. And through his  vision, i have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed mr.Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work <h6><em><sub>Janna from Seattle</sub></em></h6>  </p>
